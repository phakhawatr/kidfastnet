      "about_paragraph_1": "The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.",
      "about_paragraph_2": "The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component, containing 99.86% of the system's total mass. The Sun's gravity holds the Solar System together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris in its orbit.",
      "about_paragraph_3": "The Solar System contains 8 planets: 4 terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) in the inner solar system, and 4 gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) in the outer solar system. All planets orbit the Sun in the same direction following nearly circular paths.",
      "about_paragraph_4": "Beyond the planets lies the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, the Kuiper Belt containing Pluto and other dwarf planets, and the distant Oort Cloud, which marks the edge of the Sun's gravitational influence extending nearly halfway to the nearest star.",
