Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, earning it the nickname 'Earth's twin.' Fascinatingly, Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction to most planets (retrograde rotation), causing the Sun to rise in the west and set in the east on Venus.

Saturn is a gas giant with such low density that if there were an ocean large enough, Saturn would actually float! The planet has more than 82 moons, with Titan being the largest - bigger than Mercury and having a thick atmosphere. Saturn's winds can reach speeds of 1,800 kilometers per hour.

This extreme tilt means its poles take turns facing the Sun, creating seasons lasting 21 years each! Uranus appears blue-green due to methane in its atmosphere. Despite not being farthest from the Sun, Uranus is the coldest planet with temperatures reaching -224°C. The planet has 13 faint rings and 27 known moons.

It has a vivid deep blue color caused by methane in its atmosphere. Despite being so far from the Sun, Neptune has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of 2,100 kilometers per hour - faster than the speed of sound on Earth! Neptune has a Great Dark Spot similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, though this storm appears and disappears over time.
